# library

Tech Test :   

We have provided a group of tables that we would like you to use to create a very simple book library API from scratch (please see attachment). This task is designed to get an understanding of your ability to go from an idea to a fully working application in a short space of time.     

Task: 

1) Register a new domain with the word ‘library’ in it somewhere 
2) Build an API utilising PHP/MYSQL for a simple library application. The application should be able to execute the following: 
- List books. 
- List books by category. 
- Get book data by name/id. 
- Updates and Deletes. (Optional) 
3) Build a basic UI that will interact with the API   

Once the task is complete the API should be fully working for us to test on the new domain.   

Hints: 

- Avoid frameworks. This task is demonstrate your understanding and ability to build simple effective raw applications. 
- feel free to use any public resources to help you. i.e, google, php.net, this is not a test of your ability to remember function names and parameter order! - We have not added any indexes or relations to the tables, you can modify the tables in any way you see fit     Notes: 
- Please use version control so we can review the evolution of the code in detail. Using something like github is an easy way of doing this. 
- We understand that registering a domain will cost a small amount of money for which we are happy to reimburse you, up to a maximum of £20 
- You will not be required to keep this online past the time that we have reviewed everything, so using a free host, or if you have your own server already is fine
